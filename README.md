DATA STRUCTURES USED: QUEUES LINKED LISTS BINARY SEARCH TREES HASHTABLE (APART FROM ARRAYS AND STRINGS) FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM: DISPLAY ALL THE BOOKS INSERT A BOOK DELETE A BOOK SEARCH BOOK BY NAME ISSUE  A BOOK RETURN BOOK DISPLAY ISSUES HOW WE WILL USE THESE DATA STRUCTURES: As we have to know some type of ID (numbers) to store data in BST. So we will generate book IDs using book names. In that algorithm we will use queues. We will use hashing using a 2D array of 10 x 5 (10 rows and 5 columns) of BST. The 5 columns are the racks. The columns will be Mathematics, Computer Science, Islamiat and others at indexes 0,1,2,3 and 4 respectively. So basically our every node in BST will contain a linked list.
